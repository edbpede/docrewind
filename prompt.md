DocRewind: Project Summary (Refined)

1. Core Purpose & User Experience: 

DocRewind will be a browser extension (for Firefox and Chrome) that allows users to play back the detailed revision history of a Google Doc, creating a "movie-like" experience of the document's creation and editing process. This enables users, including teachers and students, to observe the evolution of a document.

2. Underlying Mechanism (Inspired by Draftback): 

Instead of just relying on the high-level "snapshots" available in Google Docs' standard "Version History," DocRewind will aim to access and utilize the more fine-grained edit data that Google Docs itself collects and uses to power its real-time collaboration features. The extension will not record user activity itself but will expose this existing, detailed data from Google in a user-friendly playback format. The playback will show more detail than the standard Google Docs revision history tool.

3. Key Features:

Detailed Playback: Visualize the document's progress, showing additions, deletions, and potentially formatting changes as they occurred, aiming for a continuous flow rather than just jumps between major snapshots.
User Controls: Standard playback controls such as play, pause, speed adjustment, and a timeline for scrubbing through the document's history, built with a modern and intuitive interface.
Cross-Browser Compatibility: Functional on both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

4. Access and Permissions:

Playback functionality for a specific document will only be available to users who have Edit permissions on that Google Doc, leveraging Google's existing sharing and permission model.
The extension will use Google OAuth for authentication, operating under the authenticated user's permissions to access document data.

5. Technical Foundation & Philosophy:

Core Logic Language: Developed using TypeScript.
User Interface (UI):
Framework: React will be used to build the interactive user interface components (e.g., playback controls, settings).
Styling: Tailwind CSS will be employed for styling, allowing for rapid development of a custom, modern, and responsive design.
Component Primitives: For complex interactive elements, Headless UI might be utilized to provide accessible, unstyled building blocks, styled with Tailwind CSS. Otherwise, custom React components will be built directly.
Development Principles:
Test-Driven Development (TDD): The development process will emphasize writing tests before implementing features to ensure correctness and facilitate refactoring.
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): The design and codebase will strive to minimize redundancy, promoting maintainability and clarity.
Privacy-Centric: Designed with a strong focus on user privacy.
Data Storage: It will primarily rely on fetching data directly from Google on-demand. Local browser storage will be used minimally for essentials like OAuth tokens and user preferences, with encryption considered for any sensitive cached data.
No Central Server for User Content: The extension will not store users' document content or revision histories on its own servers.
GDPR Compliance: Adherence to GDPR principles through transparency, consent (via OAuth), and data minimization.

6. Target Users:

Individual users wishing to review their own writing process.
Educators (e.g., using Google Classroom) to understand student work progression (with appropriate document sharing permissions).
Students to review their own work or collaborative projects.
